# Security simulations

This directory contains the code used to run security simulations. The datasets used are not included in this repository, so we have removed file paths and constants relating to the data. 

We used some libraries from:  
https://github.com/rchatterjee/pwmodels  
https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/ncls
